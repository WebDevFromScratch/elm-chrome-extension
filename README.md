# elm-chrome-extension

Hobby project. Front-end for a chrome extension, written in Elm language.

The extension currently fetches a randomly picked quote from the backend and displays it to the user. Next feature is to add the possibility of like/dislike (currently shown, but not working) and personalize quotes better, based on user preferences.
